### ** *Explanation of the Code* **
 

*   **Function Definition**:
     
    *   The `checkDivisibility` function takes an integer `num` as an argument.
         
    *   It returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`) based on whether the number is divisible by both `3` and `5`.
         
*   **Main Function**:
     
    *   In the `main` function, we define a variable `number` and assign it a value (in this case, `15`).
         
    *   We call the `checkDivisibility` function and store the result in the `isDivisible` variable.
         
    *   Finally, we print out whether the number is divisible by both `3` and `5` based on the result.
         

### ** *Testing the Function* **
 
You can test the function with various numbers to see how it behaves:
 

*   **Example 1**:
     
    *   Input: `30`
         
    *   Output: `30 is divisible by both 3 and 5.`
         
*   **Example 2**:
     
    *   Input: `10`
         
    *   Output: `10 is not divisible by both 3 and 5.`
