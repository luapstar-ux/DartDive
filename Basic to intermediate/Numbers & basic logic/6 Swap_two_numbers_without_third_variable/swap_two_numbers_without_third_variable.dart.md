### ** *Explanation of the Code* **
 

*   **Initialization**: We start by initializing two integer variables, `a` and `b`, with values 5 and 10, respectively.
     
*   **Before Swapping**: We print the values of `a` and `b` before the swap to see the initial state.
     
*   **Swapping Logic**:
     
    *   In the first step, we add `a` and `b` and store the result in `a`. Now, `a` holds the sum of both numbers.
         
    *   In the second step, we subtract the new value of `b` from `a` to retrieve the original value of `a`, which we store in `b`.
         
    *   Finally, we subtract the new value of `b` from `a` to retrieve the original value of `b`, which we store back in `a`.
         
*   **After Swapping**: We print the values of `a` and `b` after the swap to confirm that they have been successfully exchanged.
