### ** *Explanation:* **
 

1.  **Conversion**: The integer is converted to a string using `toString()`.
     
2.  **Negative Check**: If the number is negative, we subtract one from the length to exclude the negative sign.
     
3.  **Length Calculation**: Finally, we return the length of the string, which represents the count of digits.
